# OneBudget Requirements
This repo is intended to gather public input on initial requirements for an open-source personal finance solution.

**Please go [here](https://github.com/StokeLtd/OneBudgetRequirements/issues) to vote on existing requests or submit your own! Please use reactions over comments when simply voting for a feature.**

### Gathering Requirements
I will continue to gather requirements via this repo and other means until the end of November 2017. I will then begin technical design on 12/1.

### Overall Goal
The overall goal of this project is to provide an open-source personal finance solution that is 100% community-driven. I am starting this project to fulfill my own needs (and so it will be maintained even if I am the only user). I am a .NET/Angular developer by day, so that will be my stack of choice. I will leverage .NET Core 2.0+ to ensure the solution remains cross-platform. If there is sufficient demand, will host an "official" version of the software and charge a small monthly fee to cover hosting and maintenance. **This will not, however, be the only way to use the solution and the source will always be free to download and host yourself if desired.**

*NOTE: Once development begins, we will use GitHub to host source code, but will use YouTrack for issue tracking. Links will be posted wen the time comes!*
