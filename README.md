# OneBudget Requirements
This repo is intended to gather public input on initial requirements for an open-source personal finance solution.

**Please go [here](https://github.com/StokeLtd/OneBudgetRequirements/issues) to vote on existing requests or submit your own!**

*NOTE: Once development begins, we will use GitHub to host source code, but will use YouTrack for issue tracking. Links will be posted wen the time comes!*
